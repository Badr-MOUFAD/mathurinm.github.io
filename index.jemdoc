== About me
I am a post-doc at University of Genova, working on implicit/iterative regularization with [\/http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/ Lorenzo Rosasco] and [\/http://www.dima.unige.it/~villa/ Silvia Villa].

I did my PhD at Télécom Paris and Inria Saclay
(in the [\/https://team.inria.fr/parietal/ Parietal Team]), under the supervision of
    [\/https://josephsalmon.eu/ Joseph Salmon]
and [\/http://alexandre.gramfort.net/ Alexandre Gramfort].
My PhD aimed at improving the efficiency of brain signals reconstruction algorithms
(more details [\/http://www.theses.fr/s163051
    here]), which involves optimization, sparsity and high dimensional statistics.

I have a keen interest in the Python programming language: I am the lead developer
of the [\/https://mathurinm.github.io/celer/ celer] package (solvers for L1-type regularized problems),
and a contributor to [\/http://scikit-learn.org/ scikit-learn]
and [\/https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html MNE].
